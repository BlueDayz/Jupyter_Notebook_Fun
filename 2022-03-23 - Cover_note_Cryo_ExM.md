## Abstract
#CyroExMReview

Cryofixation has proven to be the gold standard for efficient preservation of native cell
ultra structure compared to chemical fixation, but this approach is not widely used in
fluorescence microscopy owing to implementation challenges. Here, we develop Cryo-
ExM, a method that preserves native cellular organisation by coupling cryofixation with
expansion microscopy. This method bypasses artefacts associated with chemical fixation
and its simplicity will contribute to its widespread use in super-resolution microscopy-
[[2022-03-30 - SRM|SRM]]. [[2022-03-30 - Cryo_ExM|ExM]] combines the expansion 
microscopy for super-resolution imaging with cryofixation for ultra structure preservation. 
Cryo-ExM outperforms established fixation methods on a range of sensitive sub cellular 
structures.
